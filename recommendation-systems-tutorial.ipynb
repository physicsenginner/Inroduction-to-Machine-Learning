Item Based Recommender Systems\n\n<br>What is recommender System?\n   * Based on previous(past) behaviours, it predicts the likelihood that a user would prefer an item.\n   * For example, Netflix uses recommendation system. It suggest people new movies according to their past activities that are like watching and voting movies.\n   * The purpose of recommender systems is recommending new things that are not seen before from people.\n   \n<br>\n1. User Based Collaborative Filtering\n    * Collaborative filtering is making recommend according to combination of your experience and experiences of other people.\n    * First we need to make user vs item matrix.\n        * Each row is users and each columns are items like movie, product or websites\n    * Secondly, computes similarity scores between users.\n        * Each row is users and each row is vector.\n        * Compute similarity of these rows (users).\n    * Thirdly, find users who are similar to you based on past behaviours\n    * Finally, it suggests that you are not experienced before.\n    * Lets make an example of user based collaborative filtering\n        * Think that there are two people\n        * First one watched 2 movies that are lord of the rings and hobbit\n        * Second one watched only lord of the rings movie\n        * User based collaborative filtering computes similarity of these two people and sees both are watched a lord of the rings.\n        * Then it recommends hobbit movie to second one as it can be seen picture\n        *<a href=\"https://ibb.co/droZMy\"><img src=\"https://preview.ibb.co/feq3EJ/resim_a.jpg\" alt=\"resim_a\" border=\"0\"></a>\n        \n    * User based collaborative filtering has some problems\n        * In this system, each row of matrix is user. Therefore, comparing and finding similarity between of them is computationaly hard and spend too much computational power.\n        * Also, habits of people can be changed. Therefore making correct and useful recommendation can be hard in time.\n    * In order to solve these problems, lets look at another recommender system that is item based collaborative filtering\n1. Item Based Collaborative Filtering\n    * In this system, instead of finding relationship between users, used items like movies or stuffs are compared with each others.\n    * In user based recommendation systems, habits of users can be changed. This situation makes hard to recommendation. However, in item based recommendation systems, movies or stuffs does not change. Therefore recommendation is easier.\n    * On the other hand, there are almost 7 billion people all over the world. Comparing people increases the computational power. However, if items are compared, computational power is less.\n    * In item based recommendation systems, we need to make user vs item matrix that we use also in user based recommender systems.\n        * Each row is user and each column is items like movie, product or websites.\n        * However, at this time instead of calculating similarity between rows, we need to calculate similarity between columns that are items like movies or stuffs.\n    * Lets look at how it is works.\n        * Firstly, there are similarities between lord of the rings and hobbit movies because both are liked by three different people. There is a similarity point between these two movies.\n        * If the similarity is high enough, we can recommend hobbit to other people who only watched lord of the rings movie as it can be seen in figure below.\n        *<a href=\"https://imgbb.com/\"><img src=\"https://image.ibb.co/maEQdd/resim_b.jpg\" alt=\"resim_b\"
